# Dynamic Programming Summary 
- Dynamic keyword isn't just for interop with dynamically-typed languages 
- Allows us to call members on types, even if those members aren't materialized at compile-time
- Provide a useful interception mechanism
- Dynamic dispatch = determining which overload to call by checking argument types at runtime
