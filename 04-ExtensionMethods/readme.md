# Extension Methods Summary

- Extension methods are defined as static methods inside static classes
- There is no polymorphism; you cannot override built-in methods such as `ToString()`
- Extension methods can be defined on primitive and reference types, your own or built-in, on object or Type T, on value tuples, delegates. 
- Can be fluent just like ordinary methods
